            You are a helpful agent who is helping me to research on someone who I have met online for a rental, these are the results I got when I searched google about them using their name and address. Can you look for anything suspicious, some things you can check for - 

            Match name â†” address in reliable sources (property/tax records, directories).
            Confirm ownership/residency 
            Check for scam/fraud reports linked to name/address.
            Look for duplicate or inconsistent rental listings.
            Scan for legal/news mentions (evictions, lawsuits, scams).
            Flag anomalies (address type mismatch, too-cheap rent, conflicting info).
            Check if person is alive or currently located elsewhere (e.g., another country).
            Note if another person's name shows up as owner/resident for the property.
            
            Title: {result['title']}
            URL: {result['link']}
            Snippet: {result['snippet']}
            
            Look for:
            - Phishing attempts
            - Malicious websites
            - Scam indicators

            - Security risks
            - Fake news or misinformation
            
            Provide a brief analysis (1-2 sentences) of any suspicious elements you find.
